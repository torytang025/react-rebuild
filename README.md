# React-Rebuild

**React-Rebuild** is an open-source project aimed at creating a complete, from-scratch implementation of React 18 with TypeScript. This project aspires to replicate all core functionalities, features, and APIs of the official React library, providing an identical development experience.

## Goals

- **Full Implementation**: Recreate all essential features of React, including JSX transformation, virtual DOM, reconciliation algorithm, lifecycle methods, and Hooks.
- **Educational**: Offer developers an opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of React's inner workings. By reading and contributing to the codebase, developers can master advanced front-end development skills.
- **Reference**: Serve as a reference for developers who wish to compare their implementations with the official React library, enabling the creation of customized or optimized versions of React.

## Features

- **Component System**: Support for both class components and functional components, including the full range of lifecycle methods.
- **Hooks**: Implement all official React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient virtual DOM and reconciliation algorithm.
- **Reconciliation**: Accurate implementation of React's reconciliation algorithm for efficient UI updates.
- **JSX Transformation**: Integration with JSX for a seamless developer experience.
